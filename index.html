        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>My name is Gabriella Ayala, I'm 16 years old. I currently am a concurrent student - I attend high school at Denver
          School of Innovation and Sustainable Design while I attend college at University of Colorado Denver. I also am an
          apprentice at Pinnacol Assurance and have been (or am currently) being trained to work in a variety of departments.
        </p>
        <h2>Family Life</h2>
        <p>I live with my Mom, my brother, my sister, my 2 cats and our dog. We are often found arguing with each other or
          managing to cohabitate - there is no in between. My favorite thing about me family as a whole is that we always make
          sure we are never arguing for long and are more than willing to make compromises with each other. My mom is the
          breadwinner of the house, she absolutely cannot live without coffee and it is unwise to invoke her wrath - especially
          before coffee. My sister is 13, the middle child, but most importantly the creative one; she is always trying to
          improve her drawing skills as well as herself. My 5 year old brother is too smart for his own good and loves midnight
          sandwiches. </p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
          I love to play video games on my Playstation4 and on my computer. I love to code things - especially games - and it
          makes me extremely happy when my project not only does what I expect it to but also looks fairly decent. I also love
          to read - mostly things like adventure and fantasy but especially anything that really makes you think. Lastly, and
          perhaps my favorite, I love to bug my cats occasionally just to see the faces the make and show my somewhat
          unappreciated love to them - although food is much appreciated. </p>

      <h2>Changing Fonts</h2>
      <p>I never knew how to change fonts, I always just admired them, tried to get a new font, and then great really confused as to
        how I was supposed to go about getting new fonts. However, now I know how to as well as where to get that information should
        I forget. Examples are found throughout this webpage and here are a few extra fancy fonts that I don't think would fit any
        other project.</p>
      <ul class="text-examples">
        <li>Pacifico</li>
        <li>Dancing Script</li>
        <li>Homemade Apple</li>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-2">
      <h2>Messing with JQuery</h2>
      <p> Interactivity is now within my grasp. I can make things change color when they are clicked and shake when the page is loaded
        to let the user know that they are impoartant. </p>
      <ul class="jQuery-examples">
        <li>I turn blue!</li>
        <li>I shake!</li>
        <li>I bounce!</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-3">
      <h2> Bootstrap </h2>
      <p>I also learned how to make my websites look pretty and style them in creative ways and not tear out my hair using CSS to get the
        same effects. Without my current knowledge of Bootstrap, I would not have been able to create the navigation bar and
        get everything to where I wanted it to be without running into a flurry of problems. Examples are included all over the webpage,
        from the navigation bar to the general layout of the page. I can also give things classes to change the way they look.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="text-primary">I'm primary text</li>
        <li class="text-secondary">I'm secondary text</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h2> Circular Images </h2>
      <p>I also learned how to make oval images using CSS. No longer am I confined to the use of boring old rectangular pictures - although
        no one can deny their beauty (well most of them). Here is an example. </p>

    <h2> Goals </h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Be able to adequately design something</h4>
        <p> I hope to be able to create a somewhat stunning website that no longer seems basic to me. I want to learn how to place text in
          images and the components of good and intuitive web design.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h4>Be able to release and update a website</h4>
        <p> I've always wondered how front end developers release the products they create. I've learned of one way to upload content and be
          able to update it with version control using GitHib and hope to use that in the future.
